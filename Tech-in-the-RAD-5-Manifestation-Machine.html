Reich founded the Orgone Institute ca. 1942[13] to pursue research into orgone energy after he immigrated to the US in 1939, and used it to publish literature and distribute material relating to the topic for more than a decade. Reich designed special "orgone accumulators"&mdash;devices ostensibly collecting and storing orgone energy from the environment&mdash;for improvement of general health or even for weather control.[8] Ultimately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained a federal injunction barring the interstate distribution of orgone-related materials, on the grounds that Reich and his associates were making false and misleading claims, and later jailed Reich and destroyed all orgone-related materials at the institute after Reich violated the injunction.[9] Reich rescinded the claim that accumulator could provide orgastic potency,[14] but this was not enough to stop the action.</p><h3>SINCE THE TURN OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM ORGONE PYRAMIDS HAVE BECOME A POPULAR ENERGY TOOL IN HOLISTIC AND HEALING CIRCLES. IT CREATES A POWERFUL HEALING EFFECT BY BALANCING THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGIES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.</h3><p>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health lists orgone as a type of "putative energy".[15] After Reich's death research into the concept of orgone passed to some of his students such as Kelley and later to a new generation of scientists in Germany keen to discover an empirical basis for the orgone hypothesis, (the first positive results of which were provided in 1989 by Stefan Muschenich).[16] There is no empirical support for the concept of orgone in medicine or the physical sciences,[4] and research into the concept ceased with the end of the Institute.</p><p>Albert Abrams<br />Figure 4.8). This is not a radical idea, in view of Einthoven&rsquo;s important discovery that diseases of the heart are revealed by distortions in the heart&rsquo;s electrical field, as mentioned in Chapter 5. However, Abrams is still considered by some to be &lsquo;the Dean of 20th Century Charlatans&rsquo; because of widespread disbelief in his methods. Radionic devices continue to provide skeptics with a lot of good material, although there are many patients who report successes.<br />A discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge.<br />Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi (1972)<br />Franz Anton Mesmer discovered &lsquo;animal magnetism&rsquo; and is still considered a charlatan by many. Yet we now know that he was correct &ndash; animals have biomagnetic fields around them (Chapter 9), and mesmerism or hypnosis is still widely applied. Were Abrams and Mesmer charlatans, fakes, and quacks, or were they ahead of their time?<br />The famous author, Upton Sinclair (1878&ndash;1968) heard glowing reports about the work that Abrams was doing in letters from his close friend, the famous California poet George Sterling (1869&ndash;1926). &lsquo;I should never again be afraid of getting any disease; Abrams would cure it in a week or two. He has utterly revolutionized medicine, and henceforth nine operations out of ten will be unnecessary &hellip; his diagnoses are 100 percent correct&rsquo;. Sinclair found these statements to be extreme and did not take them seriously. However, after listening to this praise of Abrams for some 10&ndash;12 years, Sinclair decided to go to San Francisco to investigate. He expected to spend a day or two, but what he found captivated him for several weeks; he would have stayed longer if urgent matters had not called him home. Sinclair was so impressed with the work of Abrams that he wrote a fascinating essay that was published in Pearson&rsquo;s Magazine in June 1922. He concluded:<br />&hellip; one thing quickly becomes clear to you. The hypothesis of fraud must be excluded &hellip; You talk with the physicians who sit watching [Abrams work]. &lsquo;Why did you come here?&rsquo; you ask, and the answer is, &lsquo;I sent Abrams some blood specimens, and found his diagnoses were right every time&rsquo;. You ask another, and get the same response. You ask a third and he says, &lsquo;He diagnosed my cancer while I was in Illinois, and cured it, so I came to learn about it&rsquo;. Half the physicians here have been cured of something, you find, and several are in the process of cure.<br />Sinclair was obviously deeply moved by the work of Abrams, by his gentle nature and his scientific rigour. He came to call the Abrams clinic &lsquo;The House of Wonder&rsquo; because of the miracles he saw taking place there. Eventually, the physicians in San Francisco began to refer to Abrams as crazy. Sinclair noted that the same thing had happened to Harvey, who is credited with the discovery of the circulation of the blood, and to Lister, who discovered antisepsis.<br />In spite of the criticisms, skepticism, and disbelief, the methods originated by Abrams have been refined by a number of investigators and appear to yield reproducible results. The equipment utilizes subtle energies that are not yet fully understood, and the energies involved are very small, as in homeopathy. This does not mean that the concepts should be rejected, for the history of medicine teaches us that what is heresy for one generation can become a dominant paradigm in the next. Valid explanations for the results obtained with these technologies may emerge from quantum physics (see Chapters 9, 11 and 13).<br />The most tragic case of skepticism, actually causing many deaths, is the story of Semmelweis in Vienna in the mid-1800s. Semmelweis attempted to introduce a completely radical medical concept, hand washing, to protect patients from an invisible force, bacteria (see box below).<br />If it were not for the pioneers and their struggles at the frontiers of human intellect and accomplishment, most of what we now value in science, medicine, and many other areas would never have become available to us. Science and biomedicine would progress at a much faster pace if the people involved were willing to consider rather than react to new ideas.</p><h1><strong>THE ORGONE THEORY</strong></h1><p>Wilhelm Reich, an Austrian psychoanalyst developed the 'ORGONE' Theory in the 1930s. After many experiments, he proposed that an etheric bio-energetic life force existed that animated our environment. His idea wasn&rsquo;t unique -&nbsp;most traditional cultures held a common belief in an invisible life energy animated the material world - called Chi in Chinese, Prana in the Indian system, Mana by the Polynesians, and by many other names across the Planet.</p><p>In Reich's view the key to physical and mental health was the balance of this orgone energy which he divided into two categories &ndash; 'Positive Orgone Energy' (POR) and anti-biological &lsquo;Deadly Orgone Energy' (DOE). He saw positive orgone as organized, structured and coherent, while anti-biological deadly orgone energy was &lsquo;stagnant&rsquo; and lead to decay and entropy &ndash; very similar to the idea of &lsquo;blockages&rsquo; in Chinese medicine.</p><p>Reich built various orgone devices such as the Orgone Accumulator Box (composed of alternating layers of wool and metal) which accumulated and infused a patient with a high concentration of orgone energy. Faster healing, increased plant growth, and positive effects on cancer were noted.</p><p>Reich expanded his theory and proposed that bio-energy could affect planetary ecosystems including weather patterns, thus the Wilhelm Reich &lsquo;Cloud Buster&rsquo; was born. It consisted of an array of metal pipes and tubing connected to water, the energetics of which he claimed could draw orgone energy to the ground producing rain.</p><p>While Wilhelm Reich&rsquo;s work was groundbreaking, his talk of &lsquo;orgasmic&rsquo; life energy (the orgasm being the spark and root of life) and non-traditional experiments drew harsh persecution from authorities. Both the Nazis and Communists in Europe and the American Food and Drug Administration went as far as to mark anything written by Reich or containing the word &lsquo;orgone&rsquo; fit for incineration. Wilhelm Reich died broke and destitute in 1957 while in prison for violating FDA regulations &ndash; a fate similar to many other visionaries like Nikola Tesla and Royal Raymond Rife.</p><br><br><iframe src="https://www.radionicsbox.com/" style="border:2px #ffffff none;" name="rad 5" scrolling="yes" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="1000px" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">The RAD 5</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">RAD5</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">RAD-5</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">RAD 5</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">RAD 5 radionics machine</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/radionics-software-orgonite/Tech-in-the-RAD-5-Manifestation-Machine.html">RAD 5 orgone generator</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
